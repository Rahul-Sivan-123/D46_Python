# Python Module End Project
This project focuses on analyzing a basketball dataset, which contains information about various players, such as their team, position, age, height, weight, college, and salary. The goal is to preprocess the dataset, perform insightful analysis, and present findings through graphical visualizations. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into player statistics and team compositions, while highlighting trends and patterns.

# Steps Done

# Preprocessing Steps

1. Converted raw data into a structured format using a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Cleaning and handling inconsistencies in the dataset, such as missing values or incorrect data types (e.g., ensuring numerical data for heights, weights, salaries, etc.).

4. Verifying data accuracy and ensuring that each field aligns with its intended type.

# Analysis Tasks
The analysis conducted on the dataset includes:

1. Determining the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.

2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.

3. Identifying the predominant age group among employees.

4. Comparing player salaries across positions and teams to identify notable trends.

5. Investigating the correlation between age and salary, and representing it visually.

# Graphical Representations

The following visualizations were created to support analysis:

  Line Charts: Displayed the employee distribution across teams and position vs employee_count.

  Scatter Plots: Illustrated correlation between age and salary.

  Bar Chart: Showed the distribution of employees by age, and salary distribution based on age team & position.

  Pie Charts: Represented employee percentage distribution acrsoss team.

  Heat Map: Showing the correlation status.

These visualizations were developed using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for the presentation of data.

# Insights Gained

 After Preprocessing the height column with random values between 150 and 180, the dataset shows normalized height distributions across all players.

# Distribution of Employees by Age Group: 

. The predominant age group with highest number of employees is '26-30'.

# Salary vs Team Analysis:
. The Most expensive team is Cleveland Cavaliers[Salary:106988689].

 # Position vs Team Analysis:
. The position with highest salary expenditure is 'C' [Salary: 466377332].

# Correlation Between Age and Salary:
. The Correlation value between Age and Salary is 0.214

# Age Groups and Performance:
. Players in their late 20s and early 30s dominate the higher salary range.
